# Wrangling-WeRateDogs
Udacity Data Analysis Nano-degree Project about Wrangling , Analyzing , and Visualising WeRateDogs dataset

The dataset that i wrangled is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
The following packages (libraries) need to be installed. You can install these packages via conda or pip.
- pandas
- NumPy
- requests
- tweepy
- json
